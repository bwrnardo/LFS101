## Some of the purposes of the other software tools required for developing a full Linux distribution

1. Performing file-related operations
2. Maintaining user management
3. Taking care of software package management

# Kernel

- Glue between hardware and applications 
- Application <-> Kernel <-> Hardware

# Distribution 

- Also know as Distro
- Collection of software making up a Linux-based OS
- Distro families (`Debian, Fedora, SUSE, etc...`)
- Individual Distros (`Ubuntu, RHEL, SLES, etc...`)

# Boot loader

- Program that boots the operating system
- For example: `GRUB and ISOLINUX`
- Boot loader <-> Linux Kernel <-> init

# Service

- Program that runs as a background process
- Example: `httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd and named`

# Filesystem

- Method for storing and organizing files
- Example: `ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS and Btrfs`
- User data -> File system 1 -> Raw Partition 1 -> Hard Disk Drive 

# X Window System 

- Graphical subsystem on nearly all Linux systems
- Provides the standard build protocol to the GUI

# Desktop Environment

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of the operating system
- For example: `GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox` 

# Command line

- Interface for typing command on top of the operating system

# Shell

- Command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instruct the operating system to perform any necessary task and commands
- For example: `bash, tcsh and zsh`
