# Philosophy and concepts

- Linus Torvalds began writing the Linux Kernel in `1991`
- Linux is a free and open source operating system drawing on the Linux Legacy
- Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects, and can often be worked using the same utilities used for regular files
- In Linux, all files are stored in one united directory tree, starting at "/", the system's root directory
- To participate in the Linux kernel development, you only need
	1. Technical skills and
	2. A desire to contribute
- Channels used to the Linux community comunicate
	1. IRC channels
	2. Mailing Lists
	3. Community events
