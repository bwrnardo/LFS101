# Viewing Files

| Command | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| cat  |  For viewing files that are not very long; it does not provide any scroll-back.
| tac  |  Look at a file backwards, starting with the last line.
| less |  View larger files because it is a paging program. It pauses at each screen full of text, provides scroll-back capabilities, and lets you search and navigate within the file
| tail |  Print the last 10 lines of a file by default. Change the number of lines by doing -n 15 or just -15 if you wanted to look at the last 15 lines instead of the default.
| head | The opposite of tail; by default, it prints the first 10 lines of a file.
